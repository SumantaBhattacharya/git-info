GIT AND GITHUB
They are related to each other, but they are different

Github
______
is a Cloud based website OR hosting server 
   [WEBSITE]LOCAL SERVER/HOST MEANS You are the only person who have access to the website
            -------------
             YOUR SYSTEM

These are the concepts It is not related to any programming language
Github Is basically one type of website where we basically host our projects, source code and various types of files.
Github Can be useful in maintaining the source CODEThat means it allows to make changes in the source code
Github works in remote server.Github is a open source For collaborative purposes.
 Git is a software tool designed for version control. Git work is to keep the track of all changes
Without Git we cannot use Github
Github Works on remote server and Git works on local server

PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project> git status
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project>
litral: saying is that it(file) is in the state of working directory,it is not yet changed/converted into remote or local repository
Until the file changed/converted into remote or local repository,it is not posiible to access through git
TO converted into remote or local repository,WE use this command
git init

PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project>git init 
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Sumanta Bhattacharya/OneDrive/Documents/Desktop/First Project/.git/
PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project> git init
Reinitialized existing Git repository in C:/Users/Sumanta Bhattacharya/OneDrive/Documents/Desktop/First Project/.git/
C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project

PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project> git status
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
___________________________________________________________________________
By default, the branch which is created in Github is called master branch.
We will always work on main branch.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

TO not converted into remote or local repository,WE use this command
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git

U untracked
PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project> git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        xyz.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project> git add xyz.txt
A index added means it has been entered into local repositary
PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project> git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   xyz.txt

red untracted
green tracked

if we delete the file from the folder
PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project> git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   xyz.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    xyz.txt

another way to transfer from the local repository to working directory but not deleted
PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project> git rm --cached xyz.txt
rm 'xyz.txt'
converted to U from A
PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project> git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        xyz.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
now we can delete it from the folder
first method The history was remained, but in the second method, the history was deleted

cls/clear to clear the terminal

PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project> git commit -m "my first commit"
[master (root-commit) 85231d7] my first commit
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 MyCode.txt

 PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project> git init -b main                
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Sumanta Bhattacharya/OneDrive/Documents/Desktop/First Project/.git/

PS C:\Users\Sumanta Bhattacharya\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\First Project> git status
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

git init(to initialise to local repository from woking directory(to add .git))
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git
git status
git add file.txt
git rm --cached file.txt
git init -b main (to change it from the branch master to main)

we will work in the main branch
